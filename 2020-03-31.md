How to mirror a github repository

```zsh
λ git clone --mirror git@github.com:company/repository.git
λ cd repository.git
λ git push --mirror git@github.com:company/otherrepo.git
```

In order for the push to work, `otherrepo.git` must exist.
When pushing to the new repo, the following error might appear:
```
! [remote rejected] refs/pull/1/head -> refs/pull/1/head (deny updating a hidden ref)
```
This is likely because a [pull request was opened](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34266401) at the previous repository.
