A few weeks ago when I worked on a [small project](https://github.com/noejon/crunch-accounting) for an interview, I ran into an issue where my header was longer than the viewport and I was unable to see elements that were aligned on the right.
My problem was that the body was much longer than the viewport with all the margin and paddings. After some googling I figured out [a solution](https://css-tricks.com/inheriting-box-sizing-probably-slightly-better-best-practice/) that is quite elegant.
And thus the box-sizing was bigger than the viewport

```css
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
*, *:before, *:after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
```
