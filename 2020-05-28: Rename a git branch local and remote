## First local

### Current branch

```zsh
git branch -m new_branch_name
```

### From another branch

```zsh
git branch -m old_branch_name new_branch_name
```

## Then remote

Once we changed a local branch name, we can change the remote name. This is not really an update, as we are deleting the remote branch and setting a new branch as upstream.
This means that any comments on pull request, or pull requests, would be deleted. This is something that we need to keep in mind.

```zsh
git push origin -u new_branch_name
```

```zsh
git push origin --delete old_branch_name
```
